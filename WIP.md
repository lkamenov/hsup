# WIP

`hsup` is a platform for experimentation.  This file, to avoid
overwhelming the README for casual reading, is for notes in testing
and developing new features.

## abspath driver

`hsup` is learning to deal with environments set up with absolute
paths, e.g. chroot environments and containers.

Example:

```
# Sets up a minimal "Cedar-14" chroot in 'tmp/root'
$ ./util/abspath-model

# Build, copy the hsup binary into the chroot's /tmp, and execute it.
$ export HEROKU_ACCESS_TOKEN=[REDACTED]
$ export HSUP_APP=[REDACTED]
$ godep go build &&
  cp hsup tmp/root &&
  sudo chroot tmp/root env \
    "HEROKU_ACCESS_TOKEN=$HEROKU_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
    /hsup run printenv -d abspath -a "$HSUP_APP"
```

## libcontainer driver

This is currently in a non-working state with many bugs, but the
general idea is to handle containerization and subsequent delegation
to the "abspath" driver:

```
$ export HEROKU_ACCESS_TOKEN=[REDACTED]
$ export HSUP_APP=[REDACTED]
$ godep go build &&
  sudo env HSUP_NEWROOT=tmp/root HSUP_HOSTNAME=whatever HSUP_USER=$(id -nu) \
  "HEROKU_ACCESS_TOKEN=$HEROKU_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  ./hsup run printenv -d libcontainer -a "$HSUP_APP"
```

Optionally, `HSUP_NEWROOT` can be a docker image ID from a local docker
repository. Available images can be listed with `docker images --no-trunc`.
